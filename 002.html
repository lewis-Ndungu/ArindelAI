    <h1>Happy Birthday Anne. Congratulations on your 19th birthday🎂🥳🎉🥳🥳🥳🤩I am really happy and proud you have accomplished this milestone (I'm still older usiringe sana😌😂). I don't know how but I've barely known you for a year but somehow I've managed to bond with you more than I have with friends I've shared years with, you're truly a blessing to have and I'm proud to be your friend, you've helped me in ways you don't even know how and I'm glad for that🥹✨️ and don't expect me to tell you how😂😂. I would most definitely want to have you in my life na usipotee😫. But for real, congratulations and I know this is just a small fraction of the great achievements you'll accomplish and I'm looking forward to witness your success, may God bless you and guide you through this new year in your life. Take care I still want to see you next sem🤗. And on yeah I wanted to call you yesterday so that I get the chance to talk to you in case today you might want to be free but that didn't happen so if you manage to get some time flash me in case I'm asleep then I call you we talk a bit, let me get the honour of talking to the birthday girl🤗😂</h1>
